= Simple AHK Looper

Simple AHK Application which will press a key every 2s to 2.5s. Tapered together for friend playing a videogame. Well actually it seems he is only playing it part-time while watching streams, else he wouldnt have the need to have a script to press a key for him ... well you know.

    TrayTip,F1 toggles this! ,-,10
    return
    F1::
    BreakLoop := !BreakLoop
    if BreakLoop = 1
    {
      TrayTip,start,-,10
      Random rand, 2000, 2500
      SetTimer,RepeatCode,%rand%
